a strange little fellow , but you could not help liking him . he was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six .
no , miss . smoking makes him spit and feel ill .
yes , sir .
you are kidding . it is almost <UNK> thirty !
charlie , just because a man and his family are colored , you-
do not bring that up . you are the one who wanted us here .
then they are not separated , are they ?

how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you ?
and again and again ! two hours late for the audition , to begin with-
what are they ?
.How come do you reckon the <UNK> is not been at 'em ?
does he know you think he is real ?
i wish to discuss your brother .
if you are protecting others of your kind , it will cost you your identity .
you are very certain my dog is okay . because you have no idea .
depends .
i am not interested in a woman who is interested in that boy .
ah , the direct approach . i admire that in a man with a mask . but you do not really think you shall ever win , playing it your way . ?

the only real truth is in the work .
so you can call me `` naive , '' mister laplante .
i followed them . an hour from the train station .
however they are , that is the deal . a buck a throw . five thousand dollars . split it half and half .
this is a very <UNK> occasion .
i am sorry . this will not take long .

what are you going to do ?
leonard , listen . i need to see if there is any nerve damage before we carry you back . look , i am trying to help you here .
i can not write this anymore .
you know , i would take you up on that in a minute . i am just not good enough to do it all by myself .

that is why tom wanted you to stay . it is better than <UNK> into my room , and i know how you hate hotels .
what did you do to your hair ?
theo .
oh g-d , i am sorry . you are not really fat ! i was just saying that because , uh , i thought that is what you wanted me to say .

thirty-five next generation <UNK> . copper , not silicon . value : one million each .
.if they are wrong ? !
the lord be with you .
no , i do not have to believe you . the jury has to believe you and answers like he is lying or she is mistaken are not going to convince them .
i wan na take that fucking blind in- <UNK> to pieces . every address book , every phone call , everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years .
<UNK> .
i did not even scratch the surface . you are lucky , boy . you come home , and nobody 's here . when i go home , everybody 's going to be there .

yeah , i heard about that .
vivian .
captain , you know , i really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television .
max , there is no crime , there is no <UNK> .
wade , it is late . i know you are probably at toby 's , but i am in bed reading . we got different habits .
helen hudson .
it is not suicide if you are already dead . two .

it took me an hour to clean it up . that was not in my head !
do you think you are a real master ?
hey , tim .
cornelius , why do you insist on <UNK> him ?
yes , mikey ?
that wall is going to need something . maybe we could put our first family picture there .
you got a tape backup , yeah , here lem me copy it on tape .
you know a lot . you have taken a lot of fancy courses in <UNK> and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that ?
that seems to be the <UNK> in your life ; ever backing down .
we we are - i was just so tempted . it was sort of a test . i think after sleeping with <UNK> i know i want to be with george . but now george knows about <UNK> and he does not want to be with me !
why not ?
and we can charge anything we want ! two thousand a day , ten thousand a day - - people will pay it ! and then there is the <UNK> - -
she gave me a ring , so i am giving her a ring . i paid twenty-five cents for it , too .
he is trying to make it .
i did not mean . with me . alice and <UNK> , they shall give you one . if you want .
to sell , of course . i hate to say it , but we are in terrible trouble here at st. katherine 's . we need a new roof , the furnace is going , and there is no money .
i do .
oh , sure .
truman , you know , i did think about moving away one time .
i can not wait to hear your opening argument . `` ladies and gentlemen of the jury . the defense will prove that jason voorhees did not kill all of these people . they , in fact , committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard . ''
yes .
i disagree . i think we should start looking into the severance pay <UNK> and make sure the people with families can .
why ?
maybe they have to pee .
where did you get it ?
what in the hell is it ? !
oh , mrs. rand -
okay . and what do you love ? say everything .
i smell nothing .
come , you are going to feed now .
you are discouraged .
i can not clean anything . the vacuum is out in the garage . i can not leave the house . why do not they tell us something ? where are all the other dead people in the world ? why is it just you and me ?
just one or two details . does he have any living relatives ? blood relatives ?
oh . oh .
not a clue . you ?
do they have any special powers ? the bosses always have special powers .
my fight 's not with you , <UNK> .
a whole ten cents ? !
what 'd i tell you ? i do not do none of that shit no more . i am in communications now .
we made it ! damn , we made it !
it shall be fine , marty . you shall be fine . good luck . he stuck his hand out and marty shook it . but there was still a question that was <UNK> at him .
you did not have to kill sophie .
do not kill me !
hello . <UNK> <UNK> . what , what is wrong , did you break down ?
oh , thank you .

you sly bastard . you are doing this to spite me , are not you !
i just need to run up and get my bathing suit .

you do not know all that has happened here- the devil has come to <UNK> .
jabez - how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present ? he will not respect me any more .
well i would not . i would never say it if it was not true .
captain sparrow ! we have to get off this island - immediately !
good .
how do they do that ?
beautiful but dangerous . once you see it <UNK> with blood , its beauty is hard to admire . it is 400 years old .
go for it .
you rigged the illusion to fail , right ?
you know the thing i hate most about children ?
no , i did not .
north island , i wish to declare myself <UNK> under section four two charlie of the international <UNK> convention .
so why all the secrecy ? why are not you guys working with the us military ?
we should talk alone .
oh man . you got ta let me do these guys . i am such a moron . i got ta make up for the tit thing .
<UNK> it .
what you do to me is unfair . the teasing , i mean .
both in the last year . i suspected only someone as brilliant as dick low could find these guys . look , whatever <UNK> told you , nobody wanted to strip richard of his badge . you have to get close to be good at what he did , the trick is not to get too close .
i think we will find what we are looking for at the <UNK> institute in <UNK> . two humpbacks called george and gracie .
really ?
i know the territory .
lucky for me you we are wandering about . thank you again . i have been terrible bother to you .
why do you hide in my room ?
no more deals , kirsty . it is your flesh we want to experience , not your skill at <UNK> .
well , let us go have some champagne , shall we ? toast all the <UNK> .
one of many people who would live a word with you .
<UNK> is <UNK> you signature , senator ?
obviously you do not think so , and i do not know why .
. two years is still a hell of a long time - and as far as we can tell there are not any <UNK> in the machine design for <UNK> food , water , even air .
you mean i should speed up and try and lose them ?
i can not .
what are you doing ? what is wrong ? i told you we have got a 4:30 .
matt ?
oh , come on ! you are not <UNK> ' this one on me . he left , i wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes . i was havin ' fun .
they do not ?
you killed them , huh ? both of them ?
look .
wait .
here , here , a thousand us dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family . to let us drive off to the mille <UNK> .
from one professional to another , of course .
`` home cooking '' .what did you call it , you said <UNK> was a tag phrase that you had , , ,
no .
[ how does it work ? ]
i shall bet he never jerks off .
i do not know , one place 's as good as another .
my baby .
well .
<UNK> ? oh shit , i hear he is a motherfucker .
you better believe it , buddy . your average rolls royce does not have to pass as many tests . you want <UNK> ? you want <UNK> ? you want safety ?
i am awake now . go on . say what you want to say . i shall listen .
i thought i would be nervous , but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed , teddy bear .
it is like smoking without <UNK> .
he says you are very sad ridiculous man . i do not agree of course . and that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute . nadia is a prostitute . i am sorry .
come in .
.Not until i get a little something to remember you by .
his wife ?
i know something better .
i just want you to know , joe , how much i appreciate your care packages on the inside .

hey !
what is nothing look like ? .it looks like nothing .
. matthew 's six , <UNK> 's four , and beth 's just nine months .
what is her name ?
it is like this big force . that is in your brain . but sometimes it grows bigger . and it spread down into your arms and legs . and it just sends you someplace .
is it one of ours ?
no ! captain rob is seven feet tall , wears an eye patch , got a hook for a hand .
the package is in the open .
why ? we did pretty well , would not you say ?
god , just think , we will never see dennis again .
no . i guess it is something about my work . i get so worked up over it , i do not know ; i do not really have a lot of attention left over , so it would be a little unfair .
i am a teenager . all teenagers are clumsy . it is because we are still growing . we do not know where our bodies end and the world begins .
what is that ?
i would not know . the closest i ever came to champagne was in a <UNK> . the wife of some president was throwing it at a <UNK> .

she was never a suspect lloyd . some animal must have done this .
my shrink says he is not so bad .
poor father .
she is a beauty , my lord , as would take a king to church for a <UNK> of a <UNK> .
but i . we do not even know each other .
gray has no need to threaten . you remember the trial ?

goodnight vada .
i saw it before it got them . i tried to yell , but . he asked me to look out for him . and i did not do it . i let him die .
now listen carefully . stan and kyle , you stand watch here and await my return . if any guards come by , make a sound like a dying <UNK> .

yeah , check out <UNK> paper , it is still not over .
six to eight months . that is with treatment . - perhaps now you can see why it is so vital that we locate your . friends .

he does not remember anything , delly . does not know how he got here , does not remember his father , the town , the bijou , anyone .
sure i can not twist your arm ?
.But i turned in my knee <UNK> .
i beg to differ . one is a command decision on your part . the other represents nothing more than the occasional <UNK> of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances .
will you lease <UNK> ?
what is that ? oh ! who gave you this ? how much is it ? wolfi , who gave you this ?
i have a better idea . i am going to put him in an <UNK> situation involving an <UNK> elaborate and exotic death .

she was a queen around the casino . she brought in high <UNK> and helped them spread around a lot of money .
five of the clock . killed a whole day playing <UNK> with a crazy <UNK> .
spoken by you ?
then you are a fool - a fool who has never lost a son . what gives you the right to judge me , to play god with the lives of others ? is it because you are so much <UNK> than everyone else ? !
what if < you > what < /you > ?
what is wrong , available ?
why would you let her to do that ?
why should they find out ? it is only two thousand dollars , bloom , do me a favor , move a few <UNK> points around . you can do it . you are an accountant . the word <UNK> ' is part of your title .
you are a very <UNK> woman , miss <UNK> .

yeah , i have to judge who can drive home and who can not . i have to keep their keys .
which one ?

i believe that your tone implied that there was some < you > good < /you > news . and , do you know . there might be good news for < you > you < /you > .
you know , the funny thing is : it is not a great movie . i mean it could have been , but they screwed it up , gave it a happy ending . and all my friends , i know they are going to smile and say they loved it .

my god , what in hell happened here ?
that is not right yet . put back `` president '' and take out `` dear '' . how does it read now ?

oh , i know exactly what you mean . i sometimes enjoy <UNK> around myself , such a pleasant way to forget one 's troubles .
no , i do not . i am not jack .
um . well , put it this way . i feel very low in myself . i can not see much in the future , and i feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me . he <UNK> forward , face into the plate of spaghetti .

so what is the big deal . oh . okay . they are like not good at basketball anymore . <UNK> , what a tragedy .
he probably wanted to drive over .
what do you expect , <UNK> me from behind ?
<UNK>
who ?
i have been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes , but i could not convince myself to stop . this <UNK> of the soil ' can get a little compulsive , you know .
you know what this is ? it is a dinosaur egg . the dinosaurs are breeding .
i hitched .
jesus , i did not say it was .
and a son by your ex-wife ? joseph .
we are all on edge , smith . we are a long way out .
you killed him ! come on with the rest of it . you killed him !
just passing through . a lonesome <UNK> with a <UNK> on his back <UNK> himself across from my garage to admire the view . there has other places to <UNK> , kid , that is all i am saying . you do not want to make a nuisance of yourself .

yes .
i love you so much , leon .
valiant and valiant ? who is the other valiant ?
she is rich . we are still married . we have no pre-nup .

what ?
we are you given an assignment to follow the activities of <UNK> deeds ?
where is he living these days ?
ugly habit , biting your nails .
i think of you and the `` boy '' all the time .
it is okay , i am done for .
this is not some kind of pissing contest , long . you may be in charge here , but those men out there are my <UNK> .
we are quite a pair , you and i .
that is very <UNK> you , aunt theresa .
is this what you wanted to speak to me about ?
we call them <UNK> . they are not supposed to be a challenge .

i am sure . as far as you know , when and where was your son last seen ?
he knew swann way back . he says there we are a lot of drugs , a lot of crazy shit .

oh , amber .
i left him hanging around the american express .
twenty-two , <UNK> .
you are going to get us hung up .
it is good with coffee .
yeah you are and you hate it . you hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine is not . that you are sweating your balls off and i am not . you have got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid , all because of me .
you go first .

<UNK> ! you sure keep my mind jumping , boy !
relax , happy . jim said to wait .
is not it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy , von <UNK> , called him a goddamn miracle , said he was a better conductor than you , then you had von der null <UNK> into the army and no one 's heard from him since ?
what are you . ?

if there is only one way out for us , there is only one way in for them .
objection , your honor . the fact that mrs. crawford heard mr. <UNK> reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court does not mean the incident never happened .

you want a dairy queen ?
everywhere . where is the food ?
thank you . no , i know you would prefer `` i am glad you < you > find < /you > me so . ''
what ?
you listen to the feelings , not the words .
if it was some poor <UNK> , <UNK> across at night , got lost in the scrub and starved out there , we would not go any further . but this is a formerly prominent citizen .

no way , no way , this is crazy .
i shall do it .

yeah , we are trying to send a message to hollywood . i am really getting tired of all the happy endings . its just not reality . in the real world the good guys die , the innocent are punished , and the murderers inherit the earth .
what is there to do ? you found the <UNK> .
the law 's on our side . if they want to challenge it , let them try .
ms. president , this is communist paranoia right out of war of the worlds . there is no reason whatsoever to believe the <UNK> intentions are hostile . we pose no threat to them - it would be like us going out of our way to destroy <UNK> on a beach in africa .
yeah ? when was the last time ?
yes , sir .
no .
your people ? your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me . you and my father . he did not think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market .

there is plenty of fruit .
my father did not die in a fire ?
well neither have i , but it is us or him . if he talks , or writes a note or whatever , he is going to turn us in . besides , he is just a low life scumbag . his kind is hardly even human anyway .

all i did was kiss a girl .
or would you rather i changed the subject ?
i appreciate the fact that you worry about me , but do not .
shut up .
<UNK> and no .
we have got nothing to worry about . he is as naive as a child .
you never said you wanted one .
you have enough worries of your own .
then i would think there must be a reason .
sofie . it is so obvious . you are after my daughter .
see if mine are in there .
we we are never properly introduced . susan and i we are fighting that day . she called him by a nickname . <UNK> or <UNK> or something .

if this was a spy novel , your next words would be something like i now know too much to live . why are you telling me all this ?
you are making it too easy .
he told me he was dying of cancer . not true . that ranch you thought you we are paying for in utah ? not true .
you knew it was me all along ?
if i want to be one with them , i have to live like them .
do you have a moment , sir ?
i am sorry . where did they send her ?

yeah , but it is not just that . to the czech mind , any movement , whether political or literary should be underground . if it is not , then it is not radical and not worthy of a <UNK> .

i thought i would ask you a few questions if that is okay .
why not ?
all right - do you want to know the truth ? i took you and marcia and ray to my sister 's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken <UNK> . so i took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed . okay ?
you need money to take a girl out
closer to eight .
how did those . ?
she does not want us to go to baltimore . she wants to meet us in new york city on valentine 's day . on top of the empire state building .
how did you do that ?
so this lawyer .
which is ?
who 'd believe it but you ? i took him out to sea and threw him in the water . even if they find him , what connects him with me ?
he implied it .
may i come in ?
i am telling you . it is not drugs . it is something more . <UNK> -
do not speak , <UNK> .
i am looking for some <UNK> professors .
i am a agent as well . kgb . i have been undercover for over a year .
look , big head , i shall be at your car .
yeah-
hi !
i used to think he was right about a lot of things but now i do not know . i thought he was going somewhere but now i think i am wasting my time .
because i can deliver the actual noc list . the one you have is not only worthless , it is certain to be equipped with a <UNK> device to <UNK> your exact location .
what are you saying , henry ? that his girlfriend fucked him to death ?
i am going to my desk .
i am probably not interested in whatever you are selling .
when you get home , i am asleep . when i leave home , you are asleep .
i shall bet . shame about ed .
no . i am the exact opposite -
<UNK> .
i do . i remember from day one . people staring at me , sensing i was different . watching the fear grow in their eyes , knowing in their hearts i was not human .
might i ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
what about you , <UNK> , you need a ride ?
oh , harold ! what a fuss this is . so unnecessary .
we will be going to warp speed -
let me tell you something . martin swayzak is going to be this town 's next mayor .

you fit in . it is lonely , it is rough at first . but you fit in . you got no choice .
one , two , three .
we think so .
i mean , if one little comment from gary is going to upset you this much -
give me some time to recall the data on our computers -
well , what , then ?
fine words from a child killer . you who murdered my brother .
`` but you did not , madam . we have all these witnesses that saw . '' well , whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him -
what am i worried about ? he shall probably be glad i started the ball rolling . all he ever did was complain about her anyway . i am just looking out for his best interests . i mean , that is what a friend does , am i right ? i did him a favor .
i am sorry , jeff . you know i could never hold my liquor -
the address jenny gave me , that was not a prison , was it ?
no , i told you . a whiff of perfume on his shirt .
<UNK> <UNK> . and you are . ?

on a good day i could not spare a <UNK> guard . but now , no way . folks 're <UNK> with the weather turning sour . bring him in yourself .
i can not do that . i have not been being fair to carl . i have to tell you that .
no , she never did .
what about us ?
bravo .
that is like . those people <UNK> nikes in panama saying they are in the nba .
jack , we would better go .

that is correct .
that is really what you want . you become furious when people will not make you dead .
so you washed it off !
actually , yeah-
what the fuck do you want ?
why ?
that is not your grandfather .
but as long as there have been vampire , there has been the <UNK> ; the line of slayers . ones with the strength and the skill to kill them , to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers . one dies , the next is called .
yep .

teddy , i thought we we are having a moment here .
where did he come from ?
just so you know , i bought you out with maxie . i suggest you leave while you can .
first they told me he had died at birth . then your father admitted he was alive , but well cared for , in secret . but the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner .
why should i go ?
sir , we stay with the president .
come on -
so . what is your dark secret ?

even it i did know where the stones we are i would never tell somebody like you .
i have heard of the arrogant male in <UNK> society . it is having a superior <UNK> power that makes you like that .

a ruler ?
do you - his brother - do you have a phone number ?
do not jerk me off . we all know what this is . you do not work with me if i work with you without knowing who i am working for . now let us cut the shit . who is the man ?
it was just that , maybe the way the sun struck the ocean , the sound of the waves . it was simple , whatever it was . then i started thinking about the last time i felt this good . it is been a long time .
detective kincaid ?
twelve are dead .
what ? what ? the leads .
i do not suppose you have seen her .

mr. king , i think -
so we will sell the house .

that is vaughan . he talked to you at the hospital .
i was wrong about you , blade . you we are never one of us . you are a traitor to your race .

for a while i thought i might go crazy .
no , that is not what i mean . i mean - look . you know what made me leave that game ? coach was giving this speech , about not <UNK> off when you see the opportunity to score .
as you have been robbed of your purse , may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might <UNK> before reaching your home ?
something like that .
can not tell if you do not say please .
take it easy !

<UNK> where ?
let me tell you something about patty .
is he all right ? is he all right ?
i thought i would wait for you .
i may run out of money , but you have already run out of bread . two years is a long time for your comrades to wait .
but you are < you > certain < /you > that he died by drowning .
in this case the secret would not be worth much . he does not know the answer himself .
thanks , josie . this was not as bad as i thought .

you are a good salesman - but i have got to think about it .
is the veronica lake <UNK> one of your whores ?
the most wonderful thing happened -
none either . it is bizarre . it is next to impossible to get russian <UNK> out . nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in '63 . a man who has <UNK> once already . it is crazy .
did you see this ? they are showing one of your movies tomorrow night .
ok .
huh ?
you look awful .
yes . and believe me , of all the other mothers i would never dream of asking you , given the <UNK> with your son . but none of the other mothers are able to go .
good night , billy .

how do i get out of here ?
oh , i got you . not too long .
what did she say ?
then what was good about it ?
we can help you through this . why do not you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with clementine .
the empress death mask .
because you keep <UNK> me , dean . i read your testimony to the warren commission and .
what the hell would they want with a gag factory ?

jeez . think he is got room for one more ?
hello , mr. cook . i was wondering if sofie was around ?
i do not think you are giving him enough credit . i know sometimes he does not think an idea through . he gets too excited . but -
yes . it was very good to see her .
what is that ?
she is a lyin ' bitch !
are you certain this is the right way ?
why 'd your mom marry that guy if she did not love him ?
i want to dictate my statement for tomorrow . i can not speak without notes . i like to have things down before me in black and white .
i was one of those silent , listening children . <UNK> to the shadows .
that fire was set . deliberately . and probably not by anyone found at the scene .
it does not matter to them .
. she is very upset .
that is really nice of you <UNK> .
okay , better question the next witness . i bet you a bottle of french champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes .
how did you get onto doom ?
it is an `` unsolved . '' they spent 500 thousand dollars & bought <UNK> a dead end - you might wan na check it with taylor , he worked the case .
let it go .
why point it at me ? i am the real thing .
just a humble perk from my dad 's construction company or should i say <UNK> company ?
zero killed them all ?
i am <UNK> out this beer bottle . trying to find out if i shall finish it or it shall finish me .

i have not <UNK> ' . i can get guns . i can get any kind of gun you want . but they have not going to help your sorry ass . you have not been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in chicago looking for you . how is that possible ?
i have been moved around all my life ; dallas , baton <UNK> , vegas , sherwood ohio , there is always a <UNK> . any town , any time , i can pop a ham and cheese in the microwave and feast on a big wheel . keeps me sane .

<UNK> .
you what ? a wire transfer of this size ?
damn , this thing is heavy . where do you want to have it ?
why did you do that , billy ?
no , it is just . no one 's ever said that . and i thought if someone did ever say it , i would have to say it first and then they would sort of say `` i love you too '' because they felt they had to after i would said it .
how long you think this 'll take ?
talk to the bomb .
cookie drew me a map to <UNK> .

an ' that is why you did not want 'em to look ?
he takes a cut of our <UNK> and <UNK> it for us . he makes us quit the life at thirty . he does not let us use narcotics and he does not abuse us . can your policeman 's mentality grasp those <UNK> ?

come clean with us , frank . we are you on this religious kick back home , or did you start to crack up here on the post ?
you say she was beat on . you call the sheriff on that ?
believe me , i am trying to get this over with as fast as i can . but samuel will probably have to come back and testify .
it is empty . why would someone build a ship like this ?
you are acting like a crazy person .
none at all ? how about those <UNK> ' comics ?
that was taken nine years ago . i.d . 'd as michael <UNK> . sentenced to 18 months in the state <UNK> at <UNK> , wyoming for armed robbery . he escaped from custody after 4 days . has not been seen or heard from since .
hmm , i see possibilities but you got a lot to do .
so . pretty nice house you have got here .
i am busy , floyd .
neither will we .
it is a romantic and tragic drink .
kick a buck .
he <UNK> everything i stand for . he thinks i am spoiled and <UNK> , and selfish , and thoroughly <UNK> .
where is your daughter ? she might be able to give us some information .
do not !
was there anything in those offices that did not go to d.c. ?
you know damn well that is not what i meant .
you know , you are the first person i have brought here .
the kiss tickets , you <UNK> ! they are just fuckin ' gone ! please tell me you have 'm !
ricky , i would advise you not to be too interested in what happens to laszlo . if by any chance you we are to help him escape -
two vodka martinis , straight up , shaken not stirred , very dry , easy on the water .
straight ahead .
where is kuato ?
nah .
unfortunately , no .
sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking .
what ?
who was that ?
how fast does this go ?
but i am your cousin !
do you need a large sum of money ? legal counsel ?
no .
<UNK> .
you sure looked funny running for those pies , bullets flying all around you .
you would not have said that before you met her .
you sure you really want to ?
i have not trying to rob you .
captain - they have been <UNK> all this week - cong and <UNK> <UNK> . there is going to be a big offense any time .
and tell cole i wanta see him when he gets in .
what <UNK> mean ?
you are not giving me a chance , fran . i asked you to meet me because - i have something to tell you . fran go ahead - tell me .
i am not everybody .
what way ?
but we would have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good .
does not matter . game 's over .
i am not rich people .
no . <UNK> , see , that is not what the doctor said . he said one 's got absolutely nothing to do with the other .
what ? ! good lord no , it is just . it is money . we needed backing and . well , we found it .
and what favour does mr. <UNK> receive from you ?
i am afraid so .
i know this sounds corny , but whenever i feel <UNK> of <UNK> pressure , i. turn to god and he helps me through the problem . call me an <UNK> , but it works .
goals are important .
did they ever find out who they we are ?
that is my scientist .
no , you would not - you are not the sort of woman that is afraid of smoke - or fire - but now let us talk about your affairs .
buy me out ? .
i shall take the lead and handle the physical threats . you watch the <UNK> time and look for exits .
so they shall go .
nothing . it is just you are a girl after my own heart .
her husband docks tomorrow , does he ?
lily , you must listen to me .
it looks that way .
do not count too much on my friendship , ricky . in this matter i am <UNK> . besides , i might lose ten thousand francs .
yes , actually .
maybe eve can guess . she is psychic .
the captain would make a much more valuable hostage .
this is my house too !
sugar ?
i do not . think so .
oh , i do not know , thelma . i guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on <UNK> . maybe we could have children with the prison guards .
i am willing to take that risk .
i can not believe he would make such a sacrifice for us .
you may discuss my <UNK> , doctor . you may discuss it with anyone you like , but not with me . i am not interested . i can solve my problems without <UNK> to a <UNK> .
who is the girl ?
you have two murders to investigate . this man 's head was beaten in . and there is nothing in his pockets .
you are with us in battle .
yes ?
which way do we go ! ?
<UNK> nation but strangely those who have interviewed <UNK> find him , in a phrase we like to use in this country , very <UNK> ' .
well that one . the one who keeps looking at me .
miss <UNK> .
this girl -
how is she ?
what are you ?
i did not mean that the way it sounded .
i did not want to bother you during your <UNK> game .

<UNK> , right , gino ?
in the name of <UNK> , prince of <UNK> , demon <UNK> .
okay , we are back in .
chill ? since when do you say <UNK> .
stay away !
i do not follow your logic . what does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting ordell 's money ?
how do you like santa carla ?
she okay ?
i was alone a lot as a child . no one to compete with . my parents <UNK> that i found happiness in the <UNK> things . when you are all alone it is your own world , you do not have to take orders from anybody . you do not necessarily believe the stories people tell you .
i do not know . ruth kept her cool , but i could tell she was surprised .
who is it ?
shelly thinks i would be a good writer .
yeah , but that was for love .
hang on there -
my mother just called you ? well , how did she know ?
we have received no news one way or the other . we can only hope for the best .
i have no money now - i must get some first - i must get some .

'No ' what ?
yes .
i would be too scared to ask him for it .
what you are doing , miss starling , is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview , and refusing to share information with me . for the third time !
here 's what you are going to do . you are going to open up your backpack , take out your bag of money , count out five thousand dollars , and hand it over to auggie .
oh - sugar !
i shall tell you what , you dedicate your first book to me , and we will forget about the whole thing .
it is not a bank .

just called the morgue , boss . they say there is a girl there
you do it on the inside .
victor . this has got to stop . nobody 's seen you in months . you have not attended a single class .

she dreamed this would happen .
not everything is <UNK> to memory . the most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy . why would the zero file be kept secret ?
i can not handle that thing .
there is one other thing you should know about me .

he did not mean it nasty . he said that gettin ' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do- especially like that .
this man 's still alive .

i shall take that under consideration , your honor .
you have been recommended by the management here . they know your father . he has a bit of a reputation , has not he ?
i think there must have been a little mix up . i told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is , there could not be any pictures . it is s'posed to be just a little story or article or something , is not that right ?
no . i had some legal training , but .
<UNK> , i figure .

margo - and bill - want us to meet them at the cub room tonight , after theater . for a bottle of wine .
so then , mr. mast .
maybe you wan na try the china club .
i did not think he would make it past scraps .
you knew that i was not before , did not you ? why did you stay with me ?
empire had the better ending : luke gets his hand cut off , and finds out vader 's his father ; han gets frozen and taken away by <UNK> <UNK> . it ends on such a down note . and that is <UNK> series of down endings . all jedi had was a bunch of <UNK> .
really ? huh , i thought for sure you would say lynette <UNK> . she is got that <UNK> vibe i know you dig .
a bad heart .
sir , if i may . echo my concern .
maybe i will one of these days .
all these camera moves and weird angles and shit are going to distance us from the emotion of the scene .
well , i am hearin ' the swede 's been <UNK> , he is flying so -
mrs. <UNK> ?
yes .
well here we are a family again . been so long plain forgot how good it feels . want to thank you for that , wyatt . all your doing ' .

i do what i got ta do to survive .
i think <UNK> cancer should be no contest .
your pay .
where is that ?
just wait . once austin gets you in his charms , it is impossible to get out .
i never could figure out why this guy orders a <UNK> weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in texas , give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced .
<UNK>
do you ?
no . it goes way back . or so my momma says .
strange . i know so very little about you .
it is the ship . the ship 's making you think this way .
<UNK> phone .
it might have been her mother .
did not you once dream you could lick people well , though ?
the irony is , after a day of the type of work he did , he would come home and read me these morbid crime stories . murders in the <UNK> morgue . le <UNK> 's green tea . my mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours .
he needed some clothes .
it is just a city park .
hey , easy .

it is so nice to see a family hanging out together .
i drink .
we had to make an example of these <UNK> that the party was over .
it is what is in that sphere , is not it , harry ? whatever you think is in that thing - you think it is going to kill you .
now listen to me .

then why did not you help the kid when you we are there ?
no .
i am not really sure . i think it is irish . or maybe -
how you doing ' ?
you stay with me .
pop , i think we should sell this place , get outta here while we are still <UNK> alive .
robert asks about you . when are you going to do something to help him ?
yeah .
thank you for being rational .
you could not bring yourself to kill me before , and i do not believe you shall destroy me now .
did you see <UNK> our <UNK> like a gum drop ? you can not even tell me what it is ! i ask you for options you give me bullshit . give them permission to enter our territories with my <UNK> regards .

are you my big brave boy ? are you my brave hero ?
do not tell me , i do not want to hear it . it is probably all fucked up , anyway .

mary hatch , why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me ?
then tell me what a king is ! is he a man who believes only what others believe ? is he one who <UNK> the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart ? there is strength in you . i see it . i know it .
so , i am done . that is it for today ?

here comes the fbi . you men lookin ' for protection ? we got all the police right here .
i said no .
i did not feel right about doing ' that . i <UNK> a shoe box from there in the she had and emptied out some <UNK> and nuts and <UNK> from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there . that seemed more proper to me , i reckon .

i do not make small talk -
not the drugstore !
the guy in interrogation said he would only talk to a cop .
hurt feelings department .

hmm ? is that a professional opinion ?
nobody could attack you . you set your life up like one of your <UNK> . you are <UNK> - but at the same time you have become trapped behind your own <UNK> . you are cut off from everyone around you .

kate ?

really ?
the machine will bring his temperature down . his vital functions are strong .

before i took the story and closed the case , i would want to know a lot more about these people . i would want to know just about everything about them .
that would be mars <UNK> . jesus , he works for me , too .

what did i say ?
select <UNK> for federal communications office . department of enforcement .
do you think ?
well , after a thing like that you would not be expected to .
well , the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of <UNK> - and the way he murders <UNK> a need to be in complete control of his victim .
how does the arm ?

there are monsters in the <UNK> !

why do not you try the assignment . or should i call and ask for somebody who can handle it ?
it seemed like a possibility . what about your intentions ? are they honorable ?
whattaya think you are in now ?
remember when we <UNK> your semen , you said that if it looked like you were not coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever ?
eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
<UNK> not seen a sign for hours . maybe it is long gone .
the only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it . he is got ta cap all three of us before they even read our rights . he is probably planning it right now .
yes . i like to watch very much .
where did you get it ?
.and to <UNK> through your son . who lives and <UNK> with you , in the <UNK> of the holy spirit , god forever and ever .
<UNK> .

it is over you , gordon .
i can not see much fun in teaching school . why do not you go into the beauty business .
no .
oh , no , harold . he does not respond well to humor . maybe if you talk to mother she can .
the same as jane mckenna .
a star is .
where does this <UNK> live ?
1000 .
why the interest ?
well , uh , who notices workers , sir ?
forgive me . i suppose i am just naturally curious about a girl like that . she is very rich , is not she ?
where is everybody ?
<UNK> the <UNK> , of course . he liked me . out of all the household staff at <UNK> , i <UNK> his favorite . i <UNK> the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime .

please god . not on us . drop it on mrs. evans . she is a cow .
i have read scripts about detectives , but never met one . must be wild .

you are welcome . ?
i knew stensland and meeks knew each other . meeks was with sue lefferts on christmas eve . the night i met lynn . lefferts ' mother <UNK> stensland as lefferts ' boyfriend , but stens pretended he did not know either one of them .
just now .
it means it is too cold to go swimming . and i do not mean the water .
how did you know ?
not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking . you seemed as if you liked to talk . i like to let people talk who like to talk . it makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are .
so , do you want to be - i mean , how do you want to do it ?
bernstein .
nope , but -
well , he is the <UNK> of the night , then .
we have been through this wendy james taylor was actually at that clinic up near boston .

for the <UNK> chair . i swear . i am becoming the <UNK> old lady i used to run from at <UNK> .
i do not want to leave .
walt , we can not throw her out of the election just because we do not like her speech . that is not what student government 's about .
taylor ! may i ask what <UNK> has to do with it ?

is that when you split up ?
no power to the bay doors .
a regret . it was just the two of us , dad . it was a lonely way to grow up . for you , too . if you had been an ordinary , average father like the other guys ' <UNK> , you would have understood that .
that is exactly right , will . so the question as i see it is not `` why should you work for <UNK> . '' it is `` why should not you ? ''
dad !
this is how you make dinosaurs ?
what does that mean ?
well , i -
i can not .
i insist .
they are ready for you , sir .
you would have done the same for me .

paul ? are you coming downstairs to eat ?
i do not have anyone to talk to things about and i understand it is confidential with a doctor - i am embarrassed about that and i do not want my sisters to know ?

'I ' will tell you what is boring . once you cover up the wallpaper , knock down a few walls , alter the traffic patterns , and - perhaps - only perhaps - think about an <UNK> pool - the place < you > might < /you > just be <UNK> . what is on the third floor ?
<UNK> , ohhh .

max , what did i do to deserve a friend like you ?
she borrowed your power to save her life . when she touches someone , she <UNK> their <UNK> - their gifts . in your case - your ability to heal . that is why she keeps her body covered .
for chrissakes , what is the problem ? you need a memo every time you fart ?

and suppose a little old lady lives there ?
but why ?
it did , but it never paid off- until now . i ought to be back within an hour . we can not leave until near dark anyway .
you call what you did bad ? ! you knocked her up and then left her !
you are learning a cruel lesson .
what ?
what would your - boyfriend - think ?
that is half a movie , with holes in it . maybe forty minutes of screen time . you do not even have a girl , a female lead , and on top of that , there is no one to sympathize with , you do not have a good guy .

to talk ? well , ok , that might be good .
what i really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment . `` can i use your phone ? '' `` how about a nightcap ? '' `` i want to meet your cat . '' and my <UNK> favorite , the old <UNK> , `` i have to use your bathroom . ''
i do not think so .

but i have to finish this .
the dirty yellow rat bastard .
well , i shall tell her i ran into you .
i believe in it for some people . i mean , for me it was silly , i was confused going in . so i just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that does not know you intimately .
do not you see it ? it is a picture of the creature .
if you do not mind dancing with an old <UNK> like me .
answer yes or no .
public display of affection . every time he moves up a rank , it is like he is got to <UNK> the screws a little <UNK>

i have always denied the legend that you we are in <UNK> american cousin ' the night lincoln was shot .
yes , monsieur ?
pat , i am not kidding . i really think it is the greatest -
<UNK> i said , it is only a physical problem . but i do feel that mr. merrick is very flattered that you are taking the time and trouble to meet him , and he is most anxious to make a good impression , so he might seem rather nervous .
and if it is ?
lois is not here ?
they are <UNK> the <UNK> . as soon as we have got some steam , we are outta here .
my <UNK> turned up two cecil <UNK> . one 's in <UNK> , montana . other 's at <UNK> <UNK> psychiatric .

dogs got no reason to live .
so are you telling me everyone knew about this <UNK> except you ?
that is not right .
the only other spook i knew was a liar . charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth . he would lie about his favorite color . but then i reckon it is an occupational hazard . all spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies .
no . what about your sister ?
roger that . opening doors now .
he is looking down . and he is not thinking 'bout the man you we are yesterday . he is proud of the man you are tonight . that is what counts .

it is pulling me deeper !
i do not care what you believe . i saved your life once , i do not plan on making a habit of it . you want my advice , you shall be out of the city by nightfall . if you are stupid enough to stay , that is your business .
charlie , i thought i knew everything about you .
i am sure they are . but what do we accomplish by pointing it out ?
huh . i did not know that . well , it is water under the bridge . and we do enter the next <UNK> , am i wrong ?

i should have known .
i shall tell you what i told officer white when he asked me about susan 's death .

i know what a <UNK> is , captain . the question is - why would someone want to create one of our village ?
right . chain of respect . that is good , that .
yes . that is true . but .
yeah ?
promise me she shall have her home .
you would have done that ?
to most people , it is an awful <UNK> .
- what ? -
i doubt arnold will be afraid .
because you did not say the magic word .
he is just being like all parents , concerned about the ones they love .
bus hit him .
three ? we should <UNK> it . buy a <UNK> . rack for the bedroom .
i think everything 's ready .
it can not be as bad as that .
with them ?
i have work to do .

because there is no way a girl could have killed them .
difference between you and me , old man , is i see the glass half full , you see it half empty .
what do you mean ?
i got ta get to my brother . if they came after me , they shall want him too .
you are a big help .
it was a <UNK> board , remember ?
military marching bands .
yes .
you know me .
we want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year . he can go all the way .
oh yeah .
well , at least they have not tried to bite us .
can you imagine that guy ? he was kissing her .
you know what , though ? i feel like i am really ready to do it . to have sex for the first time .
that is not possible . no one can do that .
that is me .
it is like the basketball team .
is it true you are getting a divorce ? comrade ?
no , i .
dad , i am sorry .
they will know you helped us , if we go this way .
<UNK> we are standing there looking at the <UNK> we are eating grass . then what ?

yes , you fucking do . i have seen your statement .
and when is she due back from that <UNK> 's convention anyway ?
no , no , no
yes . do not hurt me .
what was the response ?
i guess the best strategy 's just to tell them the truth .
oh . no . not that way . i would say it was more - i do not know - - too bad ? pathetic ?
hey , you we are never going to give me the money .
an experimental compound the romulans have been working on . in theory , a <UNK> explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an <UNK> weapon . but they never found a way to stabilize it .
oklahoma city . jimmy 's going to wire me some money , and then .
holds up a loaded fork . pauline <UNK> takes it .
you are a fool .
i would not want you to harm anybody - or destroy anything .
so we heard it . like , right that . that first .
hell , i did not know you was married .
louis , my man . watcha doing ' ?
i do not need you to get the money - my money !
you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard -
it is that hot rod joey , right ? that ' s who you want me to bend my rules for ?
what is the matter with you ?
poor kitty ; puss puss puss .
jud , this is crazy . it is going to be almost dark before we get back .
do not forget the south , sir , the west . filled with the good football <UNK> , straight kids . there is more of 'em with you than against you . not like these <UNK> .
why do not they have the same last name ? they do not have the same last name .
come on , let us call the <UNK> . we have got something to celebrate .

<UNK> a perimeter . making it safe . these guys are really good . one of them was a green .
you guys finished the <UNK> on strader yet ?

what about that other guy ?
shush ! have they <UNK> you up yet ?
we will come up with the next big thing .
the penny drops . < you > you < /you > are < you > not < /you > job . yes , job is not given to quoting <UNK> in his communications . and there was its tone - aggressive but <UNK> . job is not <UNK> . so you are something of a paradox .
so have i .
thanks for eating it . i do not know why i even pretend i can cook .
what ?
here i am , <UNK> . i am always here .
that is right .
sorry about your window .
ninotchka , i would not bring this up if we were not such good friends .
you mean you do not know where you we are ?
mr. liebkind , wait .
`` put the corporation at risk '' . ? give me a fucking break !
because she is <UNK> .
a man 's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes . only the amount matters .
so ?

she has not had a thing <UNK> today .
well . what seems to be the . ?
god ! it was god . and now i shall burn in hell because i hate him .
i will not .

i am not convinced of that , mr. president , but your visit has raised my spirits .
yes , abbe ?
please answer my question .
well , this is great . i am sick of myself and you have no idea who you are .
anybody who 'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb .

good morning to you , mr. <UNK> .
god ! and why did not you come tonight ? we all had a terrific time . i really think you would have enjoyed yourself .
`` how are you really doing , panes ? '' `` lousy , thank you , i am falling apart . ''

yes .
so you can give me more shit ?

yeah , that is what happened with me too .
i was driven out .
what would you say , too <UNK> quick .
dave .

no need . she does all her own <UNK> .
look at that .
thank you . i had a case of the clap two years ago . crabs in <UNK> . but all in all it is served me well .
i bombed . it is either work in the office or nothing .
i spoke to betty sizemore yesterday . that is right . there is no doubt in my mind , folks . she is on the run . whether or not she is mixed up in all this remains to be seen .
i shall go and see what is the matter .
. what we are you saying , admiral ? something about this <UNK> being a job for a <UNK> , <UNK> playboy spy ? '
monday .
what makes you think so ?
no .
or .

how did you get hurt ?

i hope when you we are on the bench , judge <UNK> , you did not handle the <UNK> of innocence in the same fashion .
glenn , are you trying to steal this car ?
and you want to turn pirate yourself ?
well - i am a little confused . this is a charge receipt from rosen 's drug store where mr. marsh had an account . it is dated the day of the murder . is this your signature ?
you are not afraid of anything , are you ?
we wanted ruth here for your protection as well -
jesus christ , kid . nobody 's ever cracked <UNK> .
<UNK> was the night before christmas and all through the house not a creature was <UNK> - nothing - no action - <UNK> ! you married ?
such a racket i heard in your place - maybe you had <UNK> .
what ? why the hell did he do that ?
i regret it is not too familiar .
i do not know how to deal with this . it is <UNK> . like nothing i ever saw . i am not trained to deal with a monster , a supernatural creature like that .
i do not know dude . that caitlin chick 's nice . but i see that veronica girl doing shit for you all the time . she brings you food , she <UNK> your back . did not i see her change your tire one day ?
none for me , then ?
i would like to kill that son of a bitch . i hate him .
<UNK> ?

it is will graham . is molly there , mr. <UNK> ?
now i want you to hold onto it .
oh yeah ? i guess we still need to see that price tag . like art , right ? you hang some painting that looks like <UNK> in your living room only if it costs a bundle .
almost three .
<UNK> ! where did you come from ?
the boards are solid oak <UNK> , and the floor is <UNK> by a steel grid beneath . nothing real or supernatural is busting through this , least nothing the size of the beasts .
it looks like t , but who knows ? the opportunity was there . in my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there .
darling , you can not go through any more of this . now you get together your clothes and your <UNK> and we will go out to my family 's in the country .
let him try .
i shall wish you a happy birthday now and i shall see you soon . all right , darling ?

i would not worry if i we are you . of course , a large fortune like this <UNK> a great responsibility - but you shall have a good deal of help . so do not worry . leave everything to me .
so after we kill the creature we will begin a search for the nest .
where is she ?
you . you . you mortal you !
i am not sure . i might have gotten some stories mixed up . did <UNK> condition his dogs to lick his nuts ?
if you are sayin ' you are something ' better'n what i am , that is one thing . but i can not say much a someone who 'd run off an ' leave a woman in a situation like this an ' feel easy about it . an ' that is all i got ta say .
you mean she just came here , rented the room , locked it , and left ?
kayleigh ? do you ever think about `` us ? '' i mean , wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us ?
please - just let me sleep .
a bit on the suspicious side , do not you think ?
what are you trying to say , captain -
what the fuck - ?
well , let us roll , george .
first you want me to ask for directions , then you do not . which is it ?
is it better ?
she is an exception .
<UNK> dollars .
tell us about the other guys , the ones west <UNK> out .
.and she is looking to me for support . and i think that this is leading our relationship to a new level .
i thought you we are supposed to keep them .
huh .
on the plane .
i never heard about that .
i told you what i want . lock the door !
look at all this traffic . i am not sure i can deal with it .
wickwire was there to help . to be my eyes on the inside , to make sure you we are getting a fair shot . at least that was the intent .
probably not . no . why ?
<UNK> swine . there is no such thing . <UNK> are not swine .
there is only a <UNK> , they sent a field officer out half an hour ago -
landing on the lawn in an <UNK> .
we are going .
so he is got this <UNK> of women touching themselves ? that does not make you feel weird ?
yeah man , but where is judge ?
<UNK> god .
you are not , because you eat frozen <UNK> ? things die . every time you breathe , you kill millions of tiny <UNK> . every time you eat , something had to die .
is it a star ?
not the way i can .
alright .
okay , okay . it is all so stupid . there is this guy , see . charles <UNK> . the <UNK> , that is what people call him . the kind of guy you do not want to cross paths with .
except for prom .
oh , so sorry ! did not mean to offend your droid . you think <UNK> and shutting down in that amount of time is easy ?
can we have it quiet ?
he is going to be in jail for a long time .
oh .
i still think you are okay .

as my wife testified , we we are considering it .
i figure that way we will not get confused .
i feel like shit .
i am an old friend of cochrane 's . i wanted to see how he was doing .
i am not with your party - i am sorry .

yours not to reason why , miss teschmacher . relax ! enjoy it ! just look at that <UNK> !
i was in the <UNK> . i saw your car . thought i would say hi .

we must obey our emperor and the senate .
she is - well , she is very <UNK> . that is about the best description i know .
any more complaints ?
nothing on hannah ?
maverick . where did you get that call sign ?
they thought it said , `` <UNK> me , '' `` save me , '' but it is not `` me . '' it is `` <UNK> : '' `` save yourself . ''
jesus .
yeah ? well , you just struck out . it may be a surprise to you , brad , but i want to do it the right way . not tight skirts . tight stories .
<UNK> !
i am engaged for the evening .
i think that is a <UNK> then , that would be a mistake .
i promise , dorothy . i promise .
that 'll teach me to wear white after labor day .

of course , how stupid of me . a quarter to seven , will that be all right ?
i swear , chauncey , between you and benjamin , i have got my hands full . . say , that is coming along , the <UNK> has gone down <UNK> . . any pain here ?
there is not any .
we sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery . let us turn back .
.I am positive this time .
what shall we do now ?
why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality ?
things would be worse without information retrieval .
so they tell us . but what are we to believe when the king is a <UNK> , and the church , meant to stand for all those <UNK> , has become the tool of <UNK> ? when no conscience is <UNK> ? no <UNK> , no objection ?
tomorrow when some piece like that is scratching your back in a fifth avenue <UNK> , where 'll your pal rizzo be ? <UNK> .

i think it was <UNK> who <UNK> this little <UNK> : <UNK> the button , pull the chain , out comes a chocolate <UNK> train . '
what made it .
the official because of death was a cardiac arrest .
you and the other one , you are still billy 's girls . you always we are his girls .

you have got your mother , your <UNK>
when a man has no profession except the one he <UNK> , what is left ? i began looking for people with more money than they would ever need - including some they would barely miss .
you are going to miss the train .

twenty-five .
it will not work .
it was in his bag . now it is not .
how come he let you go ?
ahem .
.this way .

frankie <UNK> . coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media . children see this . they think you are the secretary of the treasury .
faith , sir , if i want to learn good principles , it is surely better i should apply for them to your lady , and your <UNK> than to you ?
italian ? the mafia . ?
then what ? when you get through with blue and yellow , then what ?
why do we have to get up and eat with you this early ?
did you run out on me because you could not take it ? because you knew what it would be like , hiding from the police , running away all the time ?
i was trying to be smooth . but at <UNK> i was going to come over there and talk to you .
you are <UNK> .
yes .
what was it we had for dinner tonight ?
how you doing ' , boy ?
from me the doctor has no secrets . poor girl - how could you do a thing like that ?
what is your name , boy ?
it is different . he is a man . and by the way you have no business calling him a homo .
you shall like it .
my creator did not intend for me to experience these things .
so you went underground ?
babe , it is not me ! i love you ! it is god !
he was very understanding - you ought to talk to him . algeria ?
well ?
what the hell do you think 's the matter . i could wait for you someplace .
the code 's some riddle of <UNK> 's . once i am in the matrix , you shall just have to take a shot at it .
with love 's light wings did i <UNK> these walls ; for <UNK> limits can not hold love out , and what love can do that <UNK> love attempt ; therefore thy <UNK> are no let to me .

keep them coming .
i come from a big one . nine of us . all in minnesota , except me .
so how are you doing , dad ?
as you say , doctor .
<UNK> than the sword indeed .
it would not kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while -
well.i used to think that was not the worst thing in the world to look forward to . lately i am not so sure .
you got me something ? what is the occasion ?
well you guess what . the mayor sent me . i have your mr. barrenger with a history of .
i thought i am not supposed to sit with the customers .
you have to shave ? like an ape ?
yes . but if i traced creasy to you , others will do it as well . their facilities are as good as my own , if not better .
what are you doing ?
what happened ?
you can not just propose to me out of nowhere . you think that is going to solve our problems ? i am sorry , x . it was a kick for a while , but it is over . you are just not going anywhere .
look , just because you are floating does not mean i am going to forget about you giving me the finger .
where do we go - my place or yours ?
you are playing games .
did you read them ?
okay , let us go .
i am sorry , but we have no doctors here .
no , i think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today .
i am getting nowhere . the whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission . i think we should go after them .
so it did not feel . weird ?
well you we are wrong ! it was your weight on the line that did it-
not if you remember my dad .
they will not . that is not their jurisdiction .
i think a lot of this could have been avoided if sally made more of an effort .
whoa !
<UNK> can get it . right ?
- if it looks bad , it is bad for the fbi -
not what you would call rich . makes about five thousand a year .
i totally , totally hate you .

jesus , i got a hangover . want a drink ?
vaughn .

<UNK> 's comin ' out of my pocket . i got ta pay for all these trips back and forth , back and forth .

why do you think i keep her here ?
sometimes we deliberately step into those traps .
listen to you , `` directly '' . you are not going to get < you > near < /you > the news department . and if you did , it would never get on the air . <UNK> buried the <UNK> film for 15 years .

all these years , happy as we have been , how i prayed and prayed he would see fit to give us a child . and just when i finally accepted my bitter lot . no one must ever know .
oona ? do you suppose it is a faerie ?
mr. cole . not only am i a teacher . but i am also a parent of a <UNK> child . therefore , i am the only person here who <UNK> the <UNK> bridge .

of course it counts . how do you play ?
what bullshit ? hey , i am your brother . you wan na believe me - you trust me ?
now , now , do not fret .
it is a story , you decide .
i thought you would be happy to leave .
you <UNK> hopper made an appointment in this case <UNK> , jeff is not exactly fitted to the work , let us say . he is here to see <UNK> pass the time . that is important <UNK> my <UNK> everybody concerned . so , someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of <UNK>
well , you know , that happens , on the street .
you we are the <UNK> at her delivery may twelfth , nineteen seventy .
maybe you ought to wait here till they do .
no .

i can get into the <UNK> from my closet and climb all over the house .
i see .
what about finding the source ?
i know but <UNK> much is it ?
certainly - always when grusinskaya dances .
oh no . do you ?
i am afraid so , you want her ?
you lied to me .
hard to say . if we go for custody , <UNK> , psychiatric <UNK> , it could drag on . ten or twelve thousand dollars . she could win on appeal . if we just want to get the <UNK> rights <UNK> , assuming they are <UNK> <UNK> , it would not be more than twenty-five hundred .
no , we are meeting another friend . tom ripley .

yeah . yeah , i am jealous of mtv <UNK> who are named after animals .

goose is dead .
it is not the beer . he just wants to see me fail .
doolittle ! help me .
for what ?
i do not think you are very polite .
what the fuck is going on ?
i have not seen her around , and as for who would want to kill johnny crunch , line forms to the left . you would find less people on our planet who wanted him alive .
what does this guy want ?
information , baby . i thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience .
it was him , man !
yeah , but you know how society <UNK> a dedicated man .
t stands for total <UNK> , that is , all men , through original sin , are totally evil and incapable of good . <UNK> my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the lord . '

the ark of the <UNK> .
i have not been able to get you off my mind .
well i is not one of 'em !
and what about the <UNK> ?
vegas .
that is right .
your crime . as well as mine .
why did we begin this ?
once the horse reaches the castle , the fabric will make the prince suspect the <UNK> have <UNK> his love . when he finds her body dead on the guilder frontier , his suspicions will be totally confirmed .

sit down then . we often have a double up here .
just now . she is thrilled . and the kids .
- - from combined revenue <UNK> for all three <UNK> should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
alan !
`` desperately random . '' what does he mean ?
did you hear what i said ?
horseshit . nothing 's impossible .
and maybe that is why i had the bad luck . maybe if you gave me away , and i got married in a church , in a wedding dress , instead of at the city hall with strangers standing outside the door , maybe then i would not had the bad luck i had .
yeah .
harry
jesus .
i saw the flag <UNK> is up ?

the <UNK> can be a very dangerous place , mr . bond . a few words <UNK> on a piece of paper in london does not carry a lot of value out here . including life insurance .
dad ! most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends !

`` lady bird , lady bird , fly away home , your house is on fire and your children all gone '' . do you think anyone 's hurt ?
just a crazy call from a girl , probably fucked up on drugs . i would not bother you but you said call with anything unusual .
it is not the first . there is been several . and our field office in <UNK> city is getting a lot of heat . none of the investigations have turned up jack shit .
