you have got talent , anyone could see that . and he is the best . if he thinks a student has talent , he shall take 'em on for next to nothing . you are a cinch to be accepted , i could cover the cost of the lessons , like i said , it is pretty <UNK>

something i do not already know ?
even before anybody knew what a jet set was . we have had four presidents who stayed here , lots of movie stars .
sandra <UNK> .

how are you , crabtree ?
i almost shot the < you > baby < /you > .

but most people are afraid to even report these things .
your ability to <UNK> is only <UNK> by your ability to lie .
you left out condescending .
sure , <UNK> . like in that movie you rented , audrey rose .
i heard my mother ask you once `` how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty ? '' she was wrong , <UNK> , you have a generous heart .
you have eighteen of my men . i want them back .
yeah , i <UNK> <UNK> .
`` to announce your fucking presence with authority '' ? this guy 's a first ball <UNK> hitter . he is looking for heat .

you need to control yourself and < you > think < /you > before you -
so he met me and i offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price , with the intention of <UNK> it on myself to a guy i know in london .
i wondered about them , for so many years . i wondered if i looked like them , acted like them . i wondered why they gave me up .
what the hell are you laughing about ?
can you not go yourself .
you think that is wise ?
that 'll keep you busy .
what business is you in , homer ?

no . it is a lot further than that .
less than a mile . forty-one wagons , a company of <UNK> infantry , horses at the rear .
he said that ?
you think anyone who is proud of the work we do is an ass <UNK> .
yeah , that is <UNK> .
a little more was taken out before . my brother 's a director of that bank , mr. mccoy . i had a few pressing debts .
what about it ?
wait -
no , well in this case i think i can speak for him . i mean , i am pretty close to him , you know . superman will be there on wednesday .

that was for you .

the man encouraged the <UNK> to desert in this very room , in my presence . he is guilty of <UNK> and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal , regardless of what he did for my children .
good . i am good .
i am sorry -

that is all taken care of .
so they tell us . but what are we to believe when the king is a <UNK> , and the church , meant to stand for all those <UNK> , has become the tool of <UNK> ? when no conscience is <UNK> ? no <UNK> , no objection ?
jake , no -
are you sure you will not have a drink ?
i was <UNK> a kid . i think you we are here , too . but <UNK> just like you look now .

what are you going to do ?
i am sorry about steve , not myself . i am even sorry for my brother . to be so lonely , without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she is his only real family -

yes , general .
well , i guess she is more around your age . you guys could talk about things in common , like growing up in the fifties .
where we headed ?

like what ?
how did you land that ?
who said he is my good buddy ?
jack carter .
wally , the other two can still function , right ?
no , c'mon -
<UNK> for the track . you have to gas it up and save the receipts on that . his address . we have a business address too if you need that - but hit him at his house first , see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up - give him a little <UNK> -
yes ?
you talk as if he we are a <UNK> something .

no no no no no , pay her off . did you hear me ?
if these molecules are not stable , they could make us < you > worse < /you > , maybe even kill us .
a dollar forty .
and what was your reason for choosing him as your subject ?
people still need values , beliefs .
so what do i get in return ?
i pray thee , <UNK> me not ; whom i love now <UNK> grace for grace and love for love allow ; the other did not so .
you do not know that .
he is right about the ear , it is <UNK> off .
look , i can help . you need a sensor expert . you have got one .
love was never our problem .
that was not so hard .

do you mind me talking about your stuff ?
where did he ever see us ?
ten thousand cash . i do not know if it is brill 's prices going up or your commission .
george . i am at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them . but short of faking my death , or setting the theater on fire , i do not know what else to do . 'because i have always got to be one step ahead of them .

global warming ?

<UNK> <UNK> a doctor , <UNK> do not smell like ether .

i never eat when i am <UNK> .
you lost your head , it happens . i am so fuckin <UNK> ! listen . i am going to have to fly to chicago tomorrow , how 'bout if we meet in the dallas airport and we all fly into new york together for the draft ?

oh yes , i am john <UNK> .
do not you see , x ? for the <UNK> of humanity , he is going to start world war three .
i am afraid she is not so lucky . she is undead . and so am i .
i never made that claim .

i have been preoccupied .
bandit two , you read me ?
<UNK> , i would like you to meet my son , harold . harold , this is <UNK> . eh ?
how did you guess ?
what does this mean to you ?
what friend ?
i gave blood before and , uh . clothing to the poor .
nothing unusual about mr. sheldon 's leaving , <UNK> can tell by the champagne .
i am sure it is nothing . just rumors . what was it they claimed was stolen ?
come on . frozen . how much are they ?
i do not give a <UNK> in hell 's hollow what it means to her ! she can not stay in this house forever ! i fired her , damn it !
i wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority .
knock on wood .
yes .
<UNK> could pull something ! we could , i do not know , drag a car behind it !
but you can not say with any certainty that the blood was his .
they are not exactly going to <UNK> this , arlo .
you did not hire me . she did . if she wants me off the job , i want to hear it from her .
you are not going to tell me that .
and . ?
it could all be <UNK> .

i am not bad , i am just drawn that way .
do not play dumb with me , mickey . you know what i mean . describe mallory . what is up here ? what is in here ?
and you have put it <UNK> not you ?

you know what that proves ?
bowling was the most <UNK> sport . no <UNK> , no
usually at the point when she is got to rewrite and <UNK> them to keep the audience from leaving the theater !
<UNK> is a wild boast . you lack a knight 's humility .
so how did it go ?
it just never <UNK> ; once again you two <UNK> are <UNK> ' how much you want for <UNK> . there is a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
even assuming you are correct , mr. spock , why would they fire on their own president ?
whoa . <UNK> vu .
are you crazy ? what is wrong with that ?
yes . thank you . how does bill ?
i leave that in your hands .

no , thanks . i am fine . sandy .
ernie goose ? cynthia ?

into air bags . there is no <UNK> under what you are doing . i am out of it , cat . i am done .
you are avoiding the question i posed to you at the beginning of the hearing , ms. grey . three words : are mutants dangerous ?
tell me about him . you must have <UNK> something from him ! it had to happen for you as it did for me !
what is his name ?
sir - we charged ! <UNK> - and i hope you will quote me - i can not say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that <UNK> camp .
so what is that got to do with it ?
then the son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do .
he is completely lost touch with reality .
we want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers .
you do ?
actually , it is probably more like $ <UNK> and <UNK> cent . there is always <UNK> over in a big corporation , but they round it down to the lowest whole number .
if you did not kill him , then who did ?
just a moment . go ahead .
thanks . but i just want to take a bath and .
how < you > you < /you > doing ?
whose show was this on ?
no you can not lose the shot . the meaning of the < you > film < /you > < you > is < /you > in that shot .
`` of the <UNK> moon ,
i hit him from the floor with everything i knew !
can that be , er , <UNK> ? we are you alone ?
then i got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and i think i woke him probably , he was not any too alert . he just said , <UNK> , he is been <UNK> ' it and said he would send somebody over . ' lord , what a mornin ' !
so what was that other word for human . slow <UNK> ?
you are damn right i do .

<UNK> i said , it is only a physical problem . but i do feel that mr. merrick is very flattered that you are taking the time and trouble to meet him , and he is most anxious to make a good impression , so he might seem rather nervous .
<UNK> ! thou art <UNK> with romeo ?
