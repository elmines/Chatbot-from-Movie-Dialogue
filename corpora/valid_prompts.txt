.as i said , it is only a physical problem . but i do feel that mr . merrick is very flattered that you are taking the time and trouble to meet him , and he is most anxious to make a good impression , so he might seem rather nervous .

what else ?
you killed him ?
i could probably see my bedroom from here . i can see my house . when you see where you live from a distance it is like a dream , is not it ?
my daddy would say : accept with <UNK> the things you can not change .
stop jack , i am getting all <UNK> .
she let it escape because she wants me to die .
do not need it . we are <UNK> the ashes .
that is not <UNK> . you said they never changed their style , they are <UNK> .

the nightmares are nothing but a <UNK> of their real problems .

you may deny the devil , toddy , but you will not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead .
it sounds like a farm to me . calling it a dairy establishment , that is just <UNK> and <UNK> .
every * aspect * of this matter - the <UNK> attack on that <UNK> everything - was dealt with in the committee <UNK>

why ? what happened ?
that is a fine goal , i am sure . but it seems to me a ship like that - - makes this one here just a wee <UNK> .
that might not have been such a good idea . they are making us fly out of a half - <UNK> <UNK> . the real punishment is that i will not be back to the barracks till it is too late for dinner or coffee . so i guess it is goodbye for awhile .

sweetheart , we will not have to bother about our future if you are willing to <UNK> off your past !
it does indicate a <UNK> <UNK> sense of humor on the part of these ghosts - that they actually appear in sheets !
<UNK> with manchester definitely off ! " preysing , oh - i would never have thought it of you .
but he could not touch me ! we were separated !
i do not understand .
there s something about him that s just a bit odd .

so here we are again . staring three years of operational duty in the face .
still , i feel you should remove the <UNK> . wes is not an alcoholic yet , mr . holland . but as a nurse i can tell you that it will not be long before he is .
anything else ?
that leaves us no choice . we must destroy the probe before it destroys earth .
no beck 's . <UNK> , <UNK> .
who is .
i had to .
and ?
now he is the one who is locked up and i am the one who is free . if i got ta do this alone , i might as well start now . she <UNK> up and <UNK> out .
in london those radical ideas could land you in <UNK> prison . why were those people living in this <UNK> place ?

mmmmmmm ! mmmmmmm !
look , <UNK> , you are not going to leave this room until you explain yourself .
spock , could the humpback 's answer to this call be simulated ?
reason why he is pulling ah pants down .
but all those fancy courses were about the dead , jerry , not the living .
i would really rather take care of it myself .
just routine stuff .
i will take that under consideration , your honor .
.so when the sheriff returned , you showed him the injury to the deceased 's head .
dieter !

oh , there 's my bus . shit , where is my transfer !
your pop said to put these on his tab . sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door .
who is it ?
if i were you , i would worry less about the shower and more about rick 's bachelor party .
i got tired of being played with .
is there more to that , or do i have to guess ?
how often does this happen ?
yeah . it was an unusual place to be .
and another thing , where is that old mixer ?
no , i need the original note .
what do you <UNK> ?
and without it , that party is exposed - a sitting duck . no <UNK> room .
probably .
what is it ?
for what they done ? skinny gets some ponies ang that is ?
' snuck up on me . '
i do not want to hear about your fucking dreams !
get out of here !
the <UNK> the stones . where is it ?

that is <UNK> !
you mean this chocolate cake ?
but , bruce , do not keep it in your wallet . well , you see - - there 's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you - you put in the lining of your hat . that brings you good luck for ten years .
you have really got me confused , cage . on the one hand you showed leadership , courage under fire , a <UNK> to protect men you hardly knew . and on the other you have an arrest record that <UNK> you as near <UNK> . help me out here . i am not following your evolution .
<UNK> .
and what are you implying ?
louise ? where are we ?
mutants !
pardon the delay , folks , but we had to get mad bob younger under control !
<UNK> continued :
why , of course , hank - i have always got time for a neighbor . what is on your mind ?
what do you mean ?
as ship 's counselor , it is your duty to know not only when you are needed but also when you are not .
oh , my god ! ouch ! no wonder you quit .
on a hunger strike , huh ? when would she eat last ?
do not let it curl around you !
kansas !
yes , sir .
having a legend for a dad is not all it is cracked up to be .
i think . i think . that is the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that . helping the cuban <UNK> who <UNK> castro would , uh . not only be a violation of international law , it would be .
that is just my game .
yeah , but , buddy -
i do not know . sure , i guess .
sounds like you have a fear of commitment , uncle phil .
i have come now .
i am not your uncle , kid . gordo , what are you doing here ?
leave her out of this .

i have no solution for its meaning yet , but i could not just ignore it .
would you mind if we took a stroll on our own ?
no , i know that part -
i. i do not know . i guess i never thought about it . i just want to help . i want to be in on the attack . i want my own ship .

nobody gets invited to clark <UNK> parties . they just go .
i do not have it yet . it is not finished . i am sorry , but i need more time .

no they are not . i wanna be a writer , i wanna be just like you .

you are firing me ? you do not even pay me !
what is wrong , mother ?
yeah , sure .
you remember margie <UNK> ?
i did not mean to say anything bad about you . i know you are good . you did not mean no harm . did you ever think about killing yourself on purpose like my daddy did ?

hurricane 's due after midnight and we are still going out ?
that is all right . we have no secrets from our readers . mr . thatcher is one of our most devoted readers , mr . bernstein . he knows what is wrong with every issue since i have taken charge . what is the cable ?
second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump .
see anything ?
somebody must be in good humor . he was humming " mother <UNK> . "
maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have . all the girls that have been killed have been killed at night . they are all the same type . all moved into their homes within the last three months - and all of them found their homes through <UNK> .
you must have been concerned .
kimberly !
she is a good person to know . so where did you study again ?
they are acting very strange suddenly .

hard to believe there could be a monster under such <UNK> .
get the girl back under . keep going .
they obviously have no sense of historical perspective either .
shit , he is <UNK> on my feet !
do not try to <UNK> me , colonel . has another scientist been kidnapped or not ?

you . you ai not even gon na . whip 'em ?
that is okay , charlie . i am a playwright . my shows have only played new york . last one got a hell of a write - up in the herald . i guess that is why they wanted me here .
whatever . but you . i get the feeling you could have <UNK> your way into anything . so why this ?
so who changes ?
if you want a partner , i think you should <UNK> the split .
a construction job of that <UNK> would require a helluva lot more manpower than the imperial army had to offer . i will bet there were independent <UNK> working on that thing : <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> .
the airport ? why ? are you leaving ?
and you say he does not remember any of it ?
well , because you are doing all right at the minute .
nun ? was <UNK> ? <UNK> sie 's <UNK> ?

in order to do that , i have got to figure out how he plans to make money with it .
and how have you been feeling about your . work lately ?
this is the talk of a <UNK> he were your <UNK> would never put you at risk . he would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you .

my staff tells me it is been mostly drug <UNK> . i said that can not be the same edward dowd .
trying to have a relationship with you , max , is like standing in a fog bank . you know you are in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are .

that building ?
oh great . what the fuck am i supposed to do ?
you are lying to me .

ahhh . it is all fucked up . nothing adds up to nothing . you work your whole life , day in and day out- try to make sense of it all . one day you are twenty - seven and what do you get to show for it .
why do you call him that ?
and a sort of slightly sick feeling ?
questions ? well , heck , i will tell you anything you want to know .
it is still just death , the absence of life - no honor at all . it is worse than the blue soup by <UNK> that <UNK> . to you , though , it is the honor that crowns them all .
with me ?
what is that ?
why can not everyone be happy like we are - laugh and have good times . look at that poor little one so sad because she can not find her sister . and that man with her - he does not make her laugh he just sits and talks .
it was an accident . you saw it was an accident .

is your family in the apple business , too ?
as you wish .
few have survived it .
big night coming up ?
hey ! wait a minute ! there 's no birthday party for me here !
eleven o'clock !
<UNK> . how is my favorite player 's wife ?
let me see how you did that one .
a <UNK> of rye .
yeah .
grant , our <UNK> can shrink anything .
but in all that time , mike , did you ever get off a plane , walk into a room , and find that a source for a story changed his mind ? lost his heart ? walked out on us ? not one fucking time ! you want to know why ?
back up . how do you know he is gay ?
mom , i have a real job . i do good things for this community . i help people .
i have met some cynical and miserable humans in my time . but you , edward valiant , are positively <UNK> !
<UNK> . you are the one who started world war iii .
<UNK> is my boss .
i should not say this , but you are pretty , gabrielle . it is <UNK> , i know .
something wrong ?
<UNK> , my <UNK> .
i got to fetch her home .
what if we just do not tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story ?
yeah , i know what that is like . where you been ?
how much - how much do you want - you need money - you have nothing .
yes , but there was not a war .
a herring ? is not it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass <UNK> ?
why should they ?
well there you go . i let you off the hook . you are one goddamn lucky actress .
where is madame <UNK> ?
give it back !
what is happening here ? you are dead !
our doctors are seen by appointment only .
a coward . without the moral courage to stop an <UNK> <UNK> . you offend me .
no . what i have is a lot of money .
give me it .
i am getting to believe you .
recognize him ?
that where anderson worked ?
an investigation ? it was a bus accident .
tell me that it is silly of me to be <UNK> .
but your patient is legally entitled to it .
.no , they do not .
shit ! shit ! shit !
it is <UNK> whether there 's any advantage to be had from that direction . she is never been less popular .
jerking off ?
i will tell you what , barbara . i do not think we survived that crash .
shut up , you dummy . who did this to you ?
looks startled at the <UNK> .
we have come a long way since homecoming .
but before ! where did you live before !
what is a dying <UNK> sound like ?
to be determined by the proper authorities .
except i am no good at what i am being a success at .
and when you came downstairs , what happened ?
why are we doing this ?
<UNK> may be a bad time to ask this question <UNK> if <UNK> 's wrong ?
what did you do ?
he left . i could not believe it- he just left ! it is as if he is somewhere else . i am only getting a piece of him .
where would we find these <UNK> . theoretically .
so what would you guys finally decide on for the menu ?
what could somebody get for them ?
so what is your story , nick ?
we need an exit !
just take it slowly .
long live <UNK> . take a left here ?
easy micheal .
actually . i could only help him .
what is it ?
why did you call me ? the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you .
the poem . the poem was great !
i do not know .
you , of course . i need some information .
i get the picture .
what , you think there 's something funny about it ?
a through h is correct .
when you go , i go .
like i said , i had not really expected to use it . anyway , i am going through a drawer . i hear a car . i look out the window . i see nicole driving away . i leave my room , and there 's kelly .
this is <UNK> , if i am not mistaken .
did you read her mind ?
just one . some lady called . said she is a little hot - headed sometimes . but she still wants her occasional roommate . she would like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight . if it is humanly possible .
kendall maybe would have agreed , but the hurricane <UNK> the cabin -
are you a dream too ?
<UNK> 's .
well do not drag your ass . there will not be much of a window for us to link up . we will be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours .
but you explain that you are a <UNK> and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me .
i only wanted to see as others do . feel as others do . .but marguerite could not help me . nor <UNK> .
gosh , they do not give you much room around here , do they ?
huh ?
you were talking about your wedding .
i have lost interest .
you ?
only in the movies .
<UNK> not a killer . he is a pervert . he probably went out to buy more <UNK> jelly for his jack <UNK> parties he has with his two best friends .
you _ are _ two - face , you would need to face both rivers , both uptown and downtown <UNK> . only one spot in gotham serves these <UNK> <UNK> , bi - <UNK> needs .
they are used to people in trees , not in a clearing . it may be tight .
that is not funny
have you read the bible , garland ?
that does not interest me , doctor . and it is the sort of thing <UNK> would ask .
what do you think ?
last night was great .
the kids are grown ! they do not need you anymore . you told me that . they hardly talk to you .
they said i was <UNK> ?
beats me how she could get that pony out o ' camp without neither of us hearing a thing .
hey , look-
but i had no thought of <UNK> her . it was not i.
care to join us ?
back you up ? now why would i wanna do that ?
<UNK> .
but you do not have any idea as to what it is ?
<UNK> are nt types who wear a day coat , pants with <UNK> and <UNK> coat , perfect fits .
i hear you have a new play for the curtain .
this is boring , guys .
yes they do . did she have visitors ?
<UNK> .
j , what is going on out there ? get the rifle out , charles . we are being fucked .
burgel , i thought it would be easier , as long as i was passing -
really ? what do you feel ?
i do not know what that means .
if this is a joke , i am not laughing .
do we * have * to ?
yes .
they do take their time . <UNK> kyle .
what happened ?
<UNK> not like that . <UNK> is <UNK> of life . <UNK> of <UNK> and goodness .
he did not eat the kid cause he would just swallowed a bear .
well , say , buddy , is that the usual pro - <UNK> for those group <UNK> <UNK> ? bunch of chickens at a <UNK> party ?
where am i ?
you are carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend ! i do not want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns !
why the hell not ?
hey , i really enjoyed your set .
so you have got this big elaborate joke , which is really only funny to two people in the universe . you . and you .
she most certainly was not !
steady on course . all systems normal .
look jim . far be it from me to tell you what to do , but <UNK>
can not we call someone ? admiral <UNK> ?

the <UNK> wheel gets the oil .
what is this about <UNK> ? you always hated <UNK> !
several <UNK> and one primary who we have i d would as robert dean . a crystal city attorney . mr . reynolds ? sir ?
and you could stand to get a little smarter , ai not that right you dumb blonde fuck ?
what was it for ? *
you do not understand . it is an addiction . you fight night after night , trying to fill the <UNK> . but the <UNK> back in the morning . and somewhere along the way it stops being a choice . i want better for you .
sorry , mr . gekko .
you men are all so dreadful !
you did say " <UNK> " ? you are sure about that ?
did they get the <UNK> who owns this place ?
they still have to give 'em <UNK> <UNK> with mind - altering drugs .
<UNK> <UNK> . i am curious if you have it ?
often in such cases , property which has gone <UNK> legally passes to <UNK> the deceased was <UNK> to . and , who in this town is owed a great many debts ?
there are no <UNK> of the truth ! this is not a corporate maneuver , it is my life .
yes .
it is beautiful .
i am going to make you a <UNK> cake . it will make your mouth water .
let me take the lead , stephen .
who have we got ?
we would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation .
but of course you are . dinner at eight . would not miss it .
i guess i am upset because i can not really justify being upset , i mean , it is his house , really , he pays the mortgage .
i am trying .
oh , yeah . i did not know my dad . well , i knew him , till i was six . he went and married another woman , had more kids . every six years or so he would do it again - new city , new family .
you do not say ?
what dead ? who is dead ?
is this one art <UNK> or art <UNK> ?
it is not exploitation . these people wanna sell and i wanna buy . how are golf clubs exploitation ? she takes one night class and suddenly she is a <UNK> .
but it is over . isabella 's baby was the key . you saw her die and everything , right ?
right .
so what happened to you ?
you thirsty ?
well ?
. looks like you grown another inch . but you do not look so hot , getting bags under your eyes , starting to look old like me .
what is suck night ?
bud white 's been here ?
i would really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner .
<UNK> did okay , and he dropped out-
this is so nice . it is like where andy hardy would live . what is it called again ?
freak luck for sure .
<UNK> brothers are not going to change - up <UNK> . so .
maybe . but i am taking no chances . why , this kid 's got a record .
hello there , <UNK> .
ahh , not so good , man .
it is like telling <UNK> .
' course i am - but does not mean i will not leave you here . if you believe anything about me , better be that .
you know , not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this .

south of here , past <UNK> .
but you would like to know where she is ?
thank you very much , clarence .

it is funny , when i first met you i thought you were such a <UNK> still think you are a nut , but you are my nut .
i want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance . it might attract the police .
he said something about a girl -
i should do this myself .

you embarrassed me in front of the <UNK> law enforcement official in the country . do you have any idea how much money you just cost me ?
as you were , mr . saavik .
the <UNK> <UNK> is airborne with you in sight .
that would be fine , bobby .
you really are going to <UNK> , then ? you are a stubborn man .
<UNK> !
that is right .
i sat right here and said i did not want no trucoat !
i am touched , really , that they would send someone of your caliber . it is nice to know that they did not make the mistake of <UNK> me twice .
where does one man get all this junk ?
this is how you are spending my time ? having a sock hop ?
where did you get this ?
<UNK> studios .
yes , the <UNK> nurse .

it was an abandoned warehouse - hit by <UNK> . butch told ma it was just one wrong turn . said it was not your fault . you went with the training , with your instincts . if you would just gone left instead of right , you would have made it .
ang how you do it ? how you <UNK> cuss ?
i thought you were <UNK> tonight .
i want at all costs to avoid this . do we have news from the <UNK> in china ?
poison gas .
-and we got a guy in <UNK>
it is not a very big army . and small as it is you will not be able to continue feeding it for very long . we have got to find ways of getting them to respond without <UNK> on .
you have a genius for making <UNK> <UNK> out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most !
it is pretty <UNK> over there . there 's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting .
you have made some mistake there with the bushes . that is why you can not finish it .
what is our condition ?
thank you .
we are years from that . john , i am asking you : please , come in , we will shut down the system until we get this thing figured out .

for some , the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood . no matter . i had hoped to have the wedding next spring , lord <UNK> , with all the <UNK> of the kingdom in <UNK> . but fate and this war have <UNK> otherwise .
yes . i took <UNK> in the barn . would not you ? lost in the storm ? freezing and wet ? i was exhausted and could search no longer .

his last fight was his best , jeff . he and his little four - page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small <UNK> who stuck to his claim . you know , they tried everything , <UNK> , <UNK> , then - well-

it would appear that the atomic <UNK> of these crystals store information . a <UNK> efficient system .
on what basis ?
i did . i brought you back here .
well , we can not go anywhere in this darkness . how long till dawn ?
so , are you on for the next one ?

the tough part 's almost over for you . i mean , my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest .
guess which hand .
what do you mean ?
but my mother says i must not accept gifts from strangers .
so can we . so the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy . and we are shipping 'em to <UNK> asylum for the criminally insane .
forced what ?
yeah . sounds like the constitution to me . with a little of the bill of rights thrown in .
i managed .
i went to school in buffalo . paul went to school in england .
this <UNK> <UNK> - <UNK> - jail bait - but built ? ten bucks she wanted . three of us made a deal for , twenty - five , see , big goddam bargain ?

dig it , you know those brothers over in san fran . call themselves the black panthers too ?
when a creature dies , the force it generated remains . the force is all around us . it can be collected and <UNK> through the use of a <UNK> crystal . it is the only way to <UNK> the power of the force within you .
huh ?

he got it in the belly . he is still alive , but will not be for long .
