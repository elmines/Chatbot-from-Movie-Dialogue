you got a brother up in <UNK> . i know because i put him there .

thirty one 's and two <UNK> ?
well , in ' 85 four of us left our <UNK> and formed an investment banking venture . we have got twenty - three people working there now .
<UNK> . i did not think of it that way exactly , but .
fifty <UNK> directed by the white house to destroy the democrats ?
- who will whisper it to <UNK> -
<UNK> ?
have not you ever <UNK> with one of your girlfriends ?
i am not cynical . can i help it that life is a disease and everyone 's a victim . so you are producing <UNK> for grendel records now . hope you are taking julian for a bundle .
what a loser she must be . anyhow , court 's invited me to the <UNK> for labor day weekend .
oh yes ! who could forget . afterwards you sent me that amazing case of chateau <UNK> .
he left a beautiful gift in her place . a baby boy . to <UNK> and love as our very own . your brother
i will not repeat your mistake . i will have no <UNK> with the grand duchess nor her representative .
what else <UNK> you down ? candy ? cigarettes ? sex ? breathe .
i killed some <UNK> working class italian - <UNK> , but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind , gentle lover . so do not play with me .
ten to one , it belonged to cliff brumby , and like as not the bloody arcade as well . right along the coast . is not that right , <UNK> ?
never mind ... <UNK> i should tell you that ellen andrews is going to have her marriage <UNK> .
they were in a <UNK> , and
<UNK> thou say this of <UNK> , or have others told thee of me ? '
.and that the four of you <UNK> early into the morning hours .
i found a <UNK> .
let me demonstrate some <UNK> .
merely to welcome you to casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay . it is not often we have so <UNK> a visitor .
because we , and our associates , have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to <UNK> lawyers like you , because of <UNK> lawyers like you , and we would just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass - banged by as many people as possible .
reminded me of when i was a kid and the roof leaked - everybody running for the pots and <UNK> .
go to ! what , <UNK> boy ! i say , he shall : go to ; make a <UNK> among my guests !
these attacks . it is got something to do with her . uh . <UNK> .
i am not saying i believe <UNK> i heard it ' <UNK> times to know somebody did . they made a deal with the devil . y'know - " make us rich " - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit . and some stuff about ' bringing them all back through a door . '
but , i will take some of that <UNK> . you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what is wrong , you go right off .
the <UNK> announcement .
an anti - matter discharge directly <UNK> it might <UNK> the field long enough for us to break away .
what is it ? some tits ? a <UNK> shot ? what ?
margo ? <UNK> in public ?
five million dollars will buy a lot of <UNK> .
not so , <UNK> . that secretary of yours , she was not just your secretary , she <UNK> women for you , did not she ? as many and as often as you wanted .
you son of a bitch , you think you can brush me off like that ? i made my bones when you were going out with <UNK> .
for a few months . hire someone cheap . you have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance . then fire him for <UNK> . the important thing is lisa 's daughter will return to school .
coz i am short of men & <UNK> <UNK> will not do it . who ever i got free first - you get .
take it easy . the glass is bullet <UNK> .
well , just keep your bloody - fucking eyes open . do not want that <UNK> sneaking up on me bloody - fucking arse .
very <UNK> , they are . keep their feet covered up . best if you do not mention it .
well , i hope that you and your wife can come to the <UNK> . conference in june .
four <UNK> <UNK> , witness <UNK> , and cocaine theft .
is that why you became a nazi ? so you could talk about jews <UNK> ?
listen to me , peter . you can not let the <UNK> of a madman disturb you , okay ?
uh , sort of <UNK> <UNK> . with a big <UNK> . check it out next time you are up there .
<UNK> my fragile sense of security , that is what .
does the name tex <UNK> mean anything to you ?
not ghosts . at least not what you are thinking . <UNK> used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house .
has he been <UNK> ?
thank god all that <UNK> jumbo rubbish is disappearing .
the <UNK> of her car showed she had driven <UNK> miles that day . where did she go ? i have to know , scottie . where she goes and what she does , before i got involved with doctors .
we prefer to keep these <UNK> as " pleasant " as possible . i do not think a lawyer will be necessary .
you will be a lot <UNK> before we are through with you .
of course i killed them , you dumb fuck . and <UNK> every shred of evidence that proves who you really are . swallow this one , commander . you are going to be in here for the rest of your life .
nothing financial . strictly personal . i can see how all this import - <UNK> <UNK> might give rise to confusion where i am concerned . a foreigner , showing up <UNK> , like .
big bad eddie mack ? got shit for brains and that is a <UNK> . hey - heh .
fine thing jim taylor wished on me- show him the <UNK> - i need this job like i need ten pounds .
i felt so stupid just blowing those <UNK> .
we hire a lot of <UNK> here .
you know what happened to the tower of <UNK> , do not you ? it fell down .
i thought not . birds have been on this planet since <UNK> , miss daniels ; a hundred and twenty million years ago !
after we <UNK> it . that is why we have never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show . anything else ?
i would thou <UNK> my bones , and i thy news : i pray thee , speak .
<UNK> started it !
probation , <UNK> , few days a week .
<UNK> .
i do not know if " we have " noticed , but the <UNK> runs this side of the <UNK> are right outside that window -
can that kind of <UNK> be passed on <UNK> ?
you know , with the makeup and <UNK> i actually thought he was smart for a second .
even <UNK> shuttle " , you said ?
<UNK>
<UNK> orders <UNK> anymore .
<UNK> . this requires a little thought here .
i just wanted to tell you how great you were . my name 's tom <UNK> .

sometimes it got up to a quarter <UNK> <UNK> the record .

my lead bird . he is always on that top <UNK> .
he was uptown when i <UNK> him . i gave him the address . he is meeting us there .
it will do no good . he <UNK> me .
no , i would be <UNK> on her , i would be just another tongue - tied <UNK> fan .
<UNK> honey , he just wants to find arlyn page .
the question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good . goodness comes from within . goodness is chosen . when a man can not chose , he <UNK> to be a man .
<UNK> , can you hear me ? give me your name and rank .
there will be no repeat <UNK> of last night 's events . from now on , your doors will be locked during sleeping hours . we will begin a policy of evening <UNK> . for everybody .
then you are a fool - a fool who has never lost a son . what gives you the right to judge me , to play god with the lives of others ? is it because you are so much <UNK> than everyone else !
what ? <UNK> ?
o , swear not by the moon , the <UNK> moon , that monthly changes in her <UNK> <UNK> , lest that thy love prove likewise variable .
it is been nearly a year since our first time and you are still married to my sister , <UNK> now realize is fine because you are probably much more in love with her than you know .

he will . come on , git down and act like a <UNK> .
you know dr . <UNK> , our commissioner for animal affairs ?
on the contrary , you are not strange . and that in itself is confusing . i have the same idea about <UNK> la . the sense that i have been here before , that i belong here .

<UNK> . let me see .
i must tell the <UNK> . <UNK> send him a personal letter , describing your efforts , your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive .
