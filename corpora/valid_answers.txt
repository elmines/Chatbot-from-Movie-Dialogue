the world is a big , beautiful place . we can open new <UNK> in africa and asia . imagine the <UNK> <UNK> reading our magazine .

<UNK> . i did not think of it that way exactly , but .
oh yeah . there is a lot of stuff . <UNK> and <UNK> . here . i shall show you .

you have been <UNK> the family for thirty years . it is only fitting you give one <UNK> us away .
you will not tell him , and even if you did , he would clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key <UNK> when he gives the <UNK> speech at <UNK> .
those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect . <UNK> , for one .

who needs that kind of <UNK> ? who needs that kind of <UNK> at my age ? when i finish work i want to .
that is why we put <UNK> shields in place - so our people would not feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation .
but who meets him when he gets off the boat in new york in june <UNK> ?
'The work , ' jesus , ellie , can not there just once be more to life than the work ? okay , maybe that is the only way to get the recognition , win the <UNK> -
i thought you wanted to give him one of your <UNK> lectures . ned is going to do whatever he wants to do , you know .
it claims to restore monthly <UNK> .

march <UNK> .
bork , when this is all over , remind me to make you an appointment with agent <UNK> .
look , we can put you in a mental institution . we can make you look <UNK> marguerite oswald , and everybody knows how crazy she is .
i judge military matters , captain <UNK> , not you .
you are a long way from <UNK> .
how are you making out in mr. <UNK> 's office ? i do not want you working the child too hard , max - just because you promised . as you see , i kept my promise , too .
a <UNK> is good every once in a blue moon .
she was supposed to meet brad <UNK> in a bedroom . she picked the wrong one . she had no idea i was even at the party .
so what. ? the best is yet to come . check the tv guide . they got our dr. towler on a panel on <UNK> on friday : 'The healing hand . the experts speak . '
but you keep coming up with the same <UNK> crap - - heart of darkness with a million dollar budget ? ! - - no one wants to see that .
and we know that , even though most people would call you a <UNK> and a parasite , the lowest slug of humanity ! we know that deep down inside , you are probably even worse . and so you truly need our prayers .
i am your basic <UNK> . can not stand working and porn does not seem like a good option .
brown 's responsibilities are <UNK> enough already . he has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed . the <UNK> will be closed and the lights put out at twelve of the clock .
get away from me - i could never even get married 'because you could not live by <UNK> - ya 'd die by <UNK> ! so instead i put you two together - did ya think of puttin ' in a good word for me ? - you owe me !
so you did not come from the <UNK> !

we are so damned important ! look at us - <UNK> , you we are a <UNK> <UNK> , benedict , before this ?
<UNK> my sorry old truck .
strength . <UNK> does not need <UNK> <UNK> , it needs a leader . heather chandler was that leader but .
oh . but , if you please - what are <UNK> ?
fuck you ! my mother was <UNK> .
for that matter , i might as well be a girl scout tonight . i plan on making popcorn and watching doctor <UNK> . six straight hours of horror movies . little lindsey wallace will not know what hit her .
nothing completely <UNK> -
then get over on my side . oh shit , <UNK> is the fucking greatest .
you know , <UNK>
this is danny and ralph , they own the dino <UNK> salon in detroit . we used to be married .
did not think you would use that <UNK> on <UNK> if you we are one of them .
oh , i know . and then when our poor president gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed <UNK> . becomes the <UNK> .
nothing . contact paranoia . must be <UNK> ' from hanging with you .
not to mention court reynolds . unfortunately , ronald 's moving with the speed of a special olympic <UNK> .
patient apparently suffers from acute <UNK> syndrome with potential homicidal styles . work better for you ?
complete <UNK> . and then we went out and told the country they were not putting missiles into cuba . by the way , you realize we just lost the <UNK> .
<UNK> a big league move .

there has no limits to where he can strike , and we have had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days . it happened like this before , in <UNK> , when a great white killed five <UNK> at jones beach , in long island .
well , one thing i suppose , but i do not think it has anything to do with this . a friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she had spotted thomas 's father working at some gas station outside of <UNK> .
you do not happen to know how i can get around an <UNK> do you ?
it is a cover , then . a cover within a cover , a <UNK> within a <UNK> . you work for the cia , it is the only possible answer .
<UNK> .

`` <UNK> <UNK> college , <UNK> , and harvard school of medicine , <UNK> . ''
do not go <UNK> ' yourself .
no , the city does not <UNK> . it gets everybody .
no , <UNK> is not a <UNK> thing . it just means i can not climb <UNK> stairs or go to high places , like the bar at the <UNK> . but - - there are plenty of <UNK> bars in this town .
do not give me your klingon <UNK> jumbo - there is not another vessel in this whole damn quadrant .
you are a real <UNK> sort , are not you ?
but how do <UNK> do i do a film called `` the old mill , '' when i do not have an old mill ?

i thought the same thing , right off the bat . that is why we went to see the doctor . but <UNK> . turns out one 's got nothing to do with the other .
for the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the <UNK> asking the raped , or the wolf asking the sheep , `` do you hate me ! '' the white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate .
hunt is colson 's man- -that is charles colson , nixon 's special <UNK> -they both went to brown <UNK> <UNK> worked for the c.i.a . till <UNK> , and this is on deep background , the fbi thinks he is involved with the break-in .

<UNK> you are , sean . you resent me . and i am not going to apologize for any success that i have had .

<UNK> said i should move . let us not make a thing of it .
it was rio bravo . robert <UNK> was the drunk in el <UNK> , dean martin in rio bravo , practically the same part . john wayne , he also did the same thing in both . he played john wayne .

there is this whispering campaign against me ever since gates won at <UNK> .
little fuckers are thieves , <UNK> , <UNK> , murderers , you name it - they do it . do not trust any of 'em .
o deadly sin , o rude <UNK> ! this is dear mercy and thou sees it not . hence !
i do not think it is <UNK> .
i do not pretend i came over on the <UNK>
i do not think so . it is like a tv station . and they are <UNK> into mine and no one else 's .

honestly . morpheus . he got them all <UNK> up believing in bullshit . i watched each of them take on an agent and i watched each of them die . little piece of advice : you see an agent , you do what we do ; run . run your ass off .
then show a little <UNK> . there < you > is < /you > no <UNK> bomber , general scott , the best of your knowledge , is not in seattle to talk with <UNK> .

this is a murder investigation . the public should be happy to <UNK> , to get this disease off the streets .
<UNK> ?
we are trying to match them with dump site bodies . this we know is carol <UNK> from <UNK> , found her last spring . this one -
ah , yes , i forgot . god sent us an <UNK> peasant to carry out such an important mission ! do you think that god made the right decision , to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of france ?
it is a contradiction , <UNK> , get used to them . the only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets . or fake secrets .
i <UNK> this the morning they left .
so what . we would just give the <UNK> a donation that would be the end of that . no such thing as bad publicity . so what . earlier you said singing and dancing .
be surprised what these will fetch in the <UNK> system . here . this <UNK> here - easy , easy . very rare .
